# icebergProject

This project was created by group 5 in CSE 5242.
The goal of this project is to create a web interface 
where a user can choose between a set of iceberg cubing 
algorithms and examine the difference in execution time for 
different sets of data. 

##  Initial Setup 

Before the web interface is built and real data sets are 
found/created, the algorithms will be implemented and tested
using python generated data in the form of a .txt file. 
The data will be pre-processed and the algorithms will be
implemented using the processed data. 

## Algorithms
- BUC (Bottom Up Computation)
- Top-Down Computation 
- APRIORI
- H-Cubing
- Star-Cubing
- Multiway
